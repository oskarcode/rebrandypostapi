# rebrandypostapi
In this exercise, you’ll be making a POST request to the Rebrandly API to shorten a URL.

Get ready! You’re now going to incorporate the previous lesson’s boilerplate code into making an actual POST request!

If you reset the exercise at any point, you will have to paste in your API key again at the top.
